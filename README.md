# tm_cardmaker

Web App for people to make fan cards for the game Terraforming Mars.

This is currently 100% client side. It works best on a desktop/laptop but probably works on tablets and even (painfully) on phones.
You can access it at https://sliceofbread.neocities.org/tm/tm_cardmaker.html

From Jacob Fryxelius:
"Hi fellow terraformers!

FryxGames is very pleased with the creativity and imagination sparked by TM. It has been one of the design goals to inspire people, and this is proof of our success in that regard, so we couldn't be more happy.

Just to avoid any conflicts of interest, please mark all cards 'fan made' so there is a clear distinction between official and non-official content. And if you publish the cards, you'll probably want to avoid using copyrighted artwork. We also want to remind you that fan-made content may not be used commercially.

Other than that, feel free to continue the creative journey of expanding your Terraforming Mars world!

Cheers!"
